# biochemical-pathways-db
# publicly accessible database of biochemical reactions and pathways

## About the Project

This project aims to create a publicly accessible database of biochemical reactions and pathways, such as glycolysis, methionine metabolism, and many more. The database contains information about key compounds, enzymes, and reactions involved in metabolic pathways, with proper annotations and references to scientific sources (DOI).

## Goals

The goal is to expand this database to include a broader range of reactions and to create a dynamic, interconnected map of biochemical pathways that can be used by researchers, students, and enthusiasts.

## Contributing to the Project

We are looking for:
- **Biochemists and biologists** to help review and expand the list of biochemical reactions.
- **Developers** to help improve the structure, implement dynamic data visualization, and integrate the database with other tools.
- **Data scientists** to analyze and map the connections between different pathways.

If you're interested in contributing, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests!

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/biochemical-pathways-db.git
